# load_structured_data takes the variable processed_dir and uses it to locate the patients.csv, 
# notes.csv, and outcomes.csv files. These are loaded using the read_csv function in the pandas 
# library. because of the increasing complexity of this file, I have added sanity checks to look 
# for duplicate patient_ids. The three dataframes are merged on the key patient_id. The type of 
# join in this case is an inner join for merging patients and outcomes, and a left join for merging 
# notes. This is because we want to keep all patients that have outcomes data, even if they are 
# missing notes. I then added sanity checks to ensure the required columns are present in each of 
# the three dataframes. If any of the sanity checks fail, a ValueError is raised with an 
# appropriate message. If all checks pass, the merged dataframe is returned.
